## ✨ Why CueCard?

- **Always on top, always private.** CueCard opens a floating window that stays above all other applications yet is hidden from screen sharing tools. Your audience sees only your slides; you see your notes.
- **Works with Google Slides or your own text.** Use the companion browser extension to sync your existing Google Slides speaker notes, or just paste any text into the CueCard app.
- **Free and open-source.** CueCard is released under the MIT license, and the code is available on GitHub. It's completely free to use.

## ⚡ Features

CueCard focuses on the essentials so you can focus on your delivery.

### ⏰ On Time, Every Time

Write notes naturally or add simple `[time]` tags to control pacing. Use tags like `[time 00:15]` or `[time 03:00]` to schedule sections of your speech. CueCard shows a subtle on-screen countdown for each time cue.

### 📝 Note It

CueCard helps you adjust tone and energy naturally—without memorizing every change. Add `[note]` tags directly in your notes to guide your delivery. You can write anything inside a note (e.g., `[note smile]`, `[note slow down]`, `[note emphasize]`). Notes appear as colored markers next to your text.

### 👻 Ghost Mode

Keep your notes completely hidden from viewers during screen sharing or recording. Ghost Mode ensures only you can see the floating note card. Toggle visibility instantly with a single click.

### 👁️ Just Enough to See

Adjust the transparency of the note card using a simple slider. Increase opacity for clear reading or fade it for subtle visibility. Find the perfect balance between readability and discretion.
