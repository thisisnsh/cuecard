# CueCard

Speaker notes visible only to you — for presentations, meetings, dates and everything.

CueCard is a lightweight desktop teleprompter that keeps your speaker notes in view without letting anyone else see them. Whether you’re giving a presentation, or leading a meeting, you can keep your talking points floating above everything else – invisible to screen shares and recordings.

### Why CueCard?
- **Always on top, always private.** CueCard opens a floating window that stays above all other applications yet is hidden from screen sharing tools. Your audience sees only your slides; you see your notes.
- **Works with Google Slides or your own text.** Use the companion browser extension to sync your existing Google Slides speaker notes, or just paste any text into the CueCard app.
- **Free and open‑source.** CueCard is released under the MIT license, and the code is available on GitHub. It’s completely free to use.

### Features

CueCard focuses on the essentials so you can focus on your delivery:

#### On Time, Every Time

Write your notes naturally or add simple `[time]` tags to schedule your speech. CueCard reads tags like `[time 00:15]` or `[time 03:00]` and shows a gentle on‑screen countdown so you stay on schedule. While you speak, these **time cues are highlighted** and the timer counts down

#### Full of Emotions

Your tone matters just as much as your words. You can embed `[emotion]` tags directly in your notes to remind yourself to smile, emphasize a phrase or build hype. Tags like `[emotion smile]`, `[emotion emphasize]`, `[emotion excited]` and `[emotion hype]` show up as colored cues next to your text so you can **modulate your delivery without memorizing every shift in tone**.

#### Ghost Mode for Your Notes

When you’re sharing your screen or recording a video, CueCard’s ghost mode ensures your **notes remain invisible to everyone but you**. With a single click you can toggle visibility so the floating card stays off the shared screen.

#### Just Enough to See

**Adjust the transparency of the note card** with a simple slider. Dial it up for full clarity or fade it down until it’s barely noticeable – CueCard lets you find the perfect balance between visibility and discretion.
