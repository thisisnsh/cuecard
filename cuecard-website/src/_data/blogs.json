    "content": "### The Problem With Traditional Speaker Notes\n\nWhen teaching online or in hybrid classrooms, you often rely on slide notes or handwritten prompts. Unfortunately, traditional methods force you to look away, and everyone can tell you’re reading. **[CueCard](https://cuecard.dev/)** solves that problem. It’s a lightweight desktop teleprompter for Mac and Windows that lets you keep your talking points on-screen **without anyone else seeing them**. Your notes float above your presentation and remain completely invisible during screen sharing.\n\n### Why CueCard is Ideal for Teachers\n\n* **Private and always on top:** CueCard opens a floating window that stays above any application yet remains hidden from screen-sharing tools. You see your notes; your students see only the slides.\n* **Works with Google Slides or custom notes:** Sync existing speaker notes from **[Google Slides](https://cuecard.dev/google-slides/)** via the browser extension or paste any text directly into the app—no extension needed.\n* **Time and note tags:** Add `[time mm:ss]` tags to pace your lecture and `[note action]` tags to remind yourself to pause, smile, or emphasize a point.\n* **Ghost mode:** Toggle visibility off instantly so your notes are never captured in recordings.\n\n### How Teachers Use CueCard\n\n1. **Prepare your lecture:** Add headings, bullet points, or quotes in CueCard. Use `[time]` tags to ensure you cover each section on schedule and `[note]` tags to prompt tone or gestures.\n2. **Connect with Google Slides (optional):** If you use Google Slides, install the companion extension and click the “Google Slides” button in CueCard to import your speaker notes.\n3. **Teach without looking away:** Start Presenter View, hide the default notes panel, and enjoy your floating notes while students stay focused on your slides.\n\n### Wrap Up\n\nCueCard allows educators to maintain eye contact, control pacing, and stay organized during lectures, seminars, and webinars. It’s free and open-source, so there’s no downside to trying it. **Ready to level up your teaching?** Download **[CueCard for desktop](https://cuecard.dev/desktop/)** now and experience invisible speaker notes on **[Zoom](https://cuecard.dev/zoom/)**, **[Microsoft Teams](https://cuecard.dev/microsoft-teams/)**, **[Google Meet](https://cuecard.dev/google-meet/)**, and more."
