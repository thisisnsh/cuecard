    <p>At CueCard, we believe in transparency and respect for your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
        collect, use, and protect your information when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide our service:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Name and Email Address:</strong> When you sign in with Google, we collect your name and
            email address to identify you as a user. This helps us understand who uses CueCard and enables us to
            provide support when needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymous usage data. This includes:
            <ul>
                <li>App opens and session duration</li>
                <li>Feature usage (e.g., timer, settings changes)</li>
                <li>Navigation patterns within the app</li>
                <li>Platform information (Windows/macOS)</li>
            </ul>
            This data helps us understand how CueCard is used and prioritize improvements. Your email is hashed
            before being used as an identifier, ensuring your identity remains protected.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>That's it. We don't collect anything else.</p>

    <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
    <p>We want to be crystal clear about what stays on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your Notes:</strong> All speaker notes you create or paste are stored locally on your
            device. They never leave your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Tokens:</strong> Your Google authentication tokens are stored locally on your device.
            We don't have access to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentation Content:</strong> Any content synced from Google Slides remains on your device
            and is never transmitted to our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>The limited information we collect (name and email) is stored securely using Google Cloud infrastructure.
        We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your name and email solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify you as a CueCard user</li>
        <li>Provide customer support when you contact us</li>
        <li>Send important updates about the service (very rarely)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will never sell your information to third parties or use it for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>CueCard integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Authentication & Slides:</strong> We use Google services for authentication and
            Google Slides sync. When you use these features, you're also subject to
            <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
            We only request the minimum permissions necessary to provide the functionality you need.</li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics:</strong> We use Firebase Analytics (a Google service) to collect
            anonymous usage statistics. This service helps us understand app usage patterns and improve
            CueCard. Firebase Analytics data is processed according to
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase's Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Google User Data & Slides Access</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Sharing or Transfer:</strong> We do not share, transfer, or disclose your Google user data
            with anyone.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Scope Access:</strong> We only request the <code>presentations.readonly</code> scope
            to read the notes from your Google Slides presentations. This is the minimum permission needed to
            provide the sync functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Token Storage:</strong> Your Google authentication token is never persisted or
            transferred to any server. It remains stored locally on your system and never leaves your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> We only store your email address and name as part of the
            authentication process. If you wish to have this information removed, please email us at <a
                href="mailto:support@cuecard.dev">support@cuecard.dev</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your basic account information (name and email) for as long as you use CueCard. Analytics data
        is retained according to Firebase Analytics' default retention period. If you wish to have
        your information deleted, please contact us at <a
            href="mailto:support@cuecard.dev">support@cuecard.dev</a>.</p>

        <li>Request deletion of your information</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We take security seriously. Your local data is protected by your operating system's security features.
        The information stored in our cloud infrastructure is protected using industry-standard encryption and
        security practices.</p>
